## VITAL Training School 01 - Day 04

Functional connectivity map: Peter Hunter  
Functional connectivity tutorial: Finbar Argus  
Surrogate modeling: Gonzalo Maso Talou

##  Surrogate modelling

The tutorial session will require to:
- Have basic knowledge of Python coding;
- Create a Python virtual environment with TensorFlow (2.8 or higher) installed to execute the tutorial codes;
- Have enough knowledge of TensorFlow to modify network inputs and to switch network inputs with variables ([suggested TF documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/variable));
- Have enough knowledge of TensorFlow to understand neural network training loops ([suggested TF tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/quickstart/advanced));
- Download the tutorial codes host at [Animus Lab repositories](https://github.com/ABI-Animus-Laboratory/AI_surrogate_tutorial/tree/main).

Ideally, but not strongly required, we encourage you to:
- use a UNIX-like SO (this will enable us to give you better support during the tutorial);
- use an IDE such as PyCharm, VS Code or Eclipse pyDev (this will facilitate the coding and execution exercises);
- bring a computer with an NVIDIA® GPU card with CUDA® architectures 3.5, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0 and higher (this will speed up the execution of the scripts).
